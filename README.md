## Details

### Amusement Park Ticket Booking System
A web-based ticket booking system for an amusement park.

* The Amusement Park Ticket Booking project was developed using Python, JavaScript, and MySQL, showcasing my proficiency in these technologies.
* Using Vue.js, I created a dynamic and interactive user interface, incorporating smooth transitions, responsive design, and engaging animations.
* On the back-end, Django, a Python web framework, was utilized to manage the database and handle user authentication. I implemented features such as user registration and login.
* MySQL was used as the database management system to store and retrieve ticket and customer information securely.
* Deployed the system on AWS and configured Nginx as a reverse proxy.
